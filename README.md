## Usage

yarn dev
```

### Location list for autocomplete

### Model

The model is a slightly modified version of this [sketfab model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/earth-0caafb7e837047a688a3e504c0ea74af).

The transformation scripting is located at src/App/Earth/generate/generate.ts. (uncomment the lines in src/index.ts to regenerate it)
